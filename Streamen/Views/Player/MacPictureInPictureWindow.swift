//
//  MacPictureInPictureWindow.swift
//  Streamen
//
//  Hides the macOS player window while its video plays in Picture in Picture.
//
//  Once the video moves into the PiP panel the window behind it only shows
//  AVKit's "playing in Picture in Picture" placeholder, so it steps out of the
//  way and comes back when PiP ends (the panel's return button, the player's
//  own toggle, or its close button, which leaves the stream paused). With
//  "Hide App During Picture in Picture" on, the whole app hides with it.

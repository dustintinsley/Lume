#!/bin/bash
# Builds the app for iOS, macOS and tvOS side by side and fails if any of them
# does. Run before merging a branch: a change that only ever gets built for the
# platform it was made on can break another one unnoticed (a macOS-only
# modifier left the tvOS build failing for several merges).
#
# Packages resolve once, up front, into the shared CLI package clone; the three
# builds then run side by side without resolving again (three resolves into one
# clone at once trip over each other). Each builds into its own -derivedDataPath
# (/tmp/streamen-check-<label>), unsigned, for a simulator or the Mac — no device
# or provisioning needed. Warnings are listed but don't fail the check.
#
# Usage: Scripts/check-all-platforms.sh [ios|macos|tvos …]   (default: all three)
